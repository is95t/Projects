### MNIST Digit Recognition Dataset

`MNIST_digit_MLP_CNN`

This notebook contains two models trained on the MNIST digit recognition dataset. First we import the data (in this case we will use a CSV file available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv) and then we will visualize it. Next we perform some exploratory data analysis, by performing a t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) decomposition. This allows high dimensional datasets to be visualized in in a lower dimensional space. After this we need to do some data processing before we train any models. After this we will train some models, these are

- A simple 3-layer MLP neural network
- A CNN where we try to improve accuracy (this model was submitted to Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/leaderboard#)

### Simple Moving Average Strategy

`simple_moving_averages`

This notebook shows a simple trading strategy using moving averages. This strategy is not expected to be better than a Buy and Hold strategy, but this was used as a project to revise moving averages before projects involving moving averages as features in models. Although my current research involves time series, we donâ€™t typically consider moving averages, so I created this simple project to revised them from earlier in my education. In this project stock data is imported from Yahoo Finance and we look at Manchester United PLC (MANU) data from 2017 onwards (we will also look at Google (GOOG) too). Using this data, we take 2 moving averages on the closing price of the previous days, a shorter and longer. Then build a strategy based on:

If the shorter average is greater than the longer average, there is an upward trend. This is because over the previous days the short-term average of the stock price is more than the long-term average.
If the longer average is greater than the shorter average, there is a downward trend. Likewise, this is because the longer-term average of the stock price is more than the short-term, indicating a decline in the stock value.
